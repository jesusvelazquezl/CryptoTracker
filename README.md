# CryptoTracker

CryptoTracker is an iOS application that displays real-time cryptocurrency information.

## Technologies

- **UIKit** for building the user interface  
- **MVVM** as the main architectural pattern  
- **URLSession** for API communication

## Why UIKit?

I chose to build this project with **UIKit** because I was informed that the team currently uses it in the companyâ€™s iOS projects.  
This decision was made to ensure consistency with the existing codebase, make code reviews easier, and align with the stack the team is already using.
